I am Ben Roberson and I am a Master's student in computer science. I am a member of Dr. Langston's lab and I have worked as a GRA at the OIT department before, doing systems administration. I have worked with the robotics team before as well. I am concentrating in machine learning in my classes, but I am also interested most all aspects of CS / software development.
