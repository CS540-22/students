### **Self Introduction**   
Hi! I am Justin Langston, a master's student studying computer science here at UTK. I'm taking this class for my master's degree (also because Dr. Mockus is as awesome teacher, I had 340 and 545 with him). I have done two internships as an SDE at Mastercard and will be working there full-time starting next fall. My interests are in software development, machine learning, and cybersecurity. Outside of school some of my hobbies are photography, cooking, and parkour.   

### **Project Ideas**   

#### **exampleusageplz**   
API documentation often will have examples for commonly used calls, or some but not others. Documentation sites are often generated from javadocs or otherwise, describing the function and parameters. Often times this is not enough context to answer the question, ‘is this appropriate for my specific use case.’ Collection of forks of documentation for popular APIs/frameworks organized into a website with relatively simple search functionality that returns usage examples across publicly available source code with a specific API call. Users can rate and submit example usage. A reach goal would enable easy integration of the sample usage by the original maintainers.    

#### **Shell copilot**    
Use the codex API powering github copilot to power shell completion. Copilot can already effectively perform shell script completion, so with some modifications, it should also be able to be applied to an interactive shell. This can be done through traditional completion, similar to what zsh might offer, or additionally a hotkey or command to enter a 'describe mode' which allows a natural language description of what you want to accomplish with the shell.   

ie, "compress folder lab3 to lab3.tar.gz" would result in an appropriate tar command to be displayed in the shell and optionally executed.
