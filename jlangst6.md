Hi! I am Justin Langston, a master's student studying computer science here at UTK. I'm taking this class for my master's degree (also because Dr. Mockus is as awesome teacher, I had 340 and 545 with him). I have done two internships as an SDE at Mastercard and will be working there full-time starting next fall. My interests are in software development, machine learning, and cybersecurity. Outside of school some of my hobbies are photography, cooking, and parkour.
