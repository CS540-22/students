# Ian Lumsden

I am Ian Lumsden, and I am a 2nd year PhD Student in the EECS department. I am concentrating in High Performance Computing under Dr. Michela Taufer, and I have worked on multiple projects with teams from Lawrence Livermore National Lab, including the Hatchet and Flux projects. I am taking this class to fulfill my last required course for the PhD program. This is my second "formal" software engineering course. My first was COSC340 under Dr. Henley.
