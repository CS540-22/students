I am Maria Mahbub and I am a Ph.D. student at the EECS department, majoring in Computer Science. I am a research collaborator at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. I work with natural language processing in the clinical domain, focusing on mortality prediction, biomedical question answering. I would like to work at the backend part of the software systems and preferably on NLP data. I am taking this course as one of the required ones for PhD qualifying. I have done my BS and MS in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics. This is my first time taking any software systems course.
