I am Cole Johnston and I am a Undergraduate Junior from Charlotte, NC.
I enjoy coding and the critical thinking it requires.
I hope to work in the industry as a software engineer/developer for ~10 years and then hopefully create my own company.
I am taking this class becuase I believe that it will provide me with the necessary tools to succeed in a software engineering environment.
