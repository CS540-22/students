I am Aiden Rutter

## Introduction
Hi Dr. Mockus,

This is my first class with you. I have taken COSC340 in the past with Dr. Henley. 
I did some research with him as a part of his lab. I'm finishing my master's degree now.
I'd like to use this as an experience to deploy a tool that will have real world value and
help me develop my full stack skills.

## prefabricated background blurb
I'm a recent graduate with a master's degree in computer science from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. I've been developing software as a freelance developer and as a hobby since I was little. I’ve stayed busy throughout college, spending a couple of hours a day working on embedded software projects related to my robotics team. I’ve also got a pretty strong background in deep learning and python for data science. Beyond that, I’m familiar with building REST services in a handful of programming languages, namely C#, Java, and python. I’ve had some great internship and research experiences at places like Amazon and Oak Ridge National Lab. During this time I’ve applied git workflow, agile, and test-driven development.
