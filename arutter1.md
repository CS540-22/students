I am Aiden Rutter

## Introduction
Hi Dr. Mockus,

This is my first class with you. I have taken COSC340 in the past with Dr. Henley. 
I did some research with him as a part of his lab. I'm finishing my master's degree now.
I'd like to use this as an experience to deploy a tool that will have real world value and
help me develop my full stack skills.

## prefabricated background blurb
I'm a recent graduate with a master's degree in computer science from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. I've been developing software as a freelance developer and as a hobby since I was little. I’ve stayed busy throughout college, spending a couple of hours a day working on embedded software projects related to my robotics team. I’ve also got a pretty strong background in deep learning and python for data science. Beyond that, I’m familiar with building REST services in a handful of programming languages, namely C#, Java, and python. I’ve had some great internship and research experiences at places like Amazon and Oak Ridge National Lab. During this time I’ve applied git workflow, agile, and test-driven development.  

## project ideas

API documentation often will have examples for commonly used calls, or some but not others. Documentation sites are often generated from javadocs or otherwise, describing the function and parameters. Often times this is not enough context to answer the question, ‘is this appropriate for my specific use case.’
Collection of forks of documentation for popular APIs/frameworks organized into a website with relatively simple search functionality that returns usage examples across publicly available source code with a specific API call. Users can rate and submit example usage. A reach goal would enable easy integration of the sample usage by the original maintainers.

* Shell copilot
Use the codex API powering github copilot to power shell completion. Copilot can already effectively perform shell script completion, so with some modifications, it should also be able to be applied to an interactive shell. This can be done through traditional completion, similar to what zsh might offer, or additionally a hotkey or command to enter a 'describe mode' which allows a natural language description of what you want to accomplish with the shell.

ie, 
`compress folder lab3 to lab3.tar.gz`
would result in an appropriate tar command to be displayed in the shell and optionally executed.
