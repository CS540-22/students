I am Spencer Howell and I am a graduate student at UT. I am in the 5 year BS/MS program for computer science, so this is my tenth and final semester at UT.

Over the last several years, I have interned as a mobile developer for Garmin, mostly working on Android apps. I really enjoy designing and implementing user interfaces. I have the most experience with Android apps written with Kotlin and Flutter apps in Dart, but I am interested in learning new languages and frameworks as well.

Thanks for reading, contact me at showel17@vols.utk.edu if you want to get in touch!
