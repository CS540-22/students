I am Jacob Samar and I am a master's student in my last semester. I previously recieved my BS in computer science from UTK.

I am interested in any sort of automation that can be leveraged to increase productivity, particularly programmer productivity. 
Any sort of tool that can improve workflows either through automation or data/cloud computing would be interesting to work on.
