I am Mahmoud Jahanshahi. I'm a first year PhD student. I've been in digital archeology class last semester. I'm looking forward to get more familiar with software engineering considering my different background. My interest is in code quality and developer expertise in open source software. This is a mandatory course for me by the way.
