I am Damian Seals and I am a student and Graduate Teacher's Assistant here in EECS at UTK. I have interned at Discovery here in Knoxville and done my fair share of retail and food-service jobs, as well as one bout working construction. I like playing musical instruments, socializing, visiting family, and exercising. As for a project idea, I think I might join Ben's project, but I haven't decided for certain.
