I am Hunter Leef and I am a graduate student (Master's) and teaching assistant at the EECS department. I have worked at a license plate recognition company
previously and am currently a member of Dr. Langston's laboratory. My most recent research is an investigation of Type I Diabetes using graph methods and this
research is in collaboration with UTHSC in Memphis. I don't have an idea on a project at the moment. I have taken COSC 340 in undergrad and have no preference as
to whether the class is online or in-person but if one day is online I would prefer it to be on Friday.
