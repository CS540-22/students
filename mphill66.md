I'm Madeline Phillips. I am in the final semester of my Master's degree in CS. I've been working in cybersecurity for the past few years, and would be interested in working on a security-related software development project. I've used static analysis tools and fuzzers to detect vulnerabilities on security evaluations. I would be interested in integrating these tools into the development process somehow.
