I am Jacob McLemore.

I'm a Master's student at UTK who works professionally as a software engineer at PolySign Inc.
I took CS340 previously at UTK and am taking this class both for professional advancement and to complete my Master's degree.
I'm love games of any kind, but especially love tabletop roleplaying games.
This semester I would like to implement an automated version of a small tabletop rpg.
