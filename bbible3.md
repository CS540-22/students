I am Bryce Bible. I reently graduated with my BS in COSC, and am continuing to get my MS. I have taken your Digital Archaeology and COSC340 courses, and absolutely loved them.
Software design has always been my passion and is what led me to choose COSC. I am doing research at UT that involves software design,
and additionally doing work with software design for Kansai Gaidai University in Japan. I want to gain skills in software design
and learn and ingrain good practices in my workflow. I am looking forward to this course!
