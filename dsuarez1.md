I am Kae Suarez, an MS student at the EECS department at UTK Knoxville, performing HPC research under Dr. Michela Taufer in collaboration with Lawrence Livermore National Lab currently, and other institutions in the past. I enjoy developing HPC solutions for domain scientists, and have a focus on LGBTQ+ rights outside of my main professional responsibilities. I am taking this course to sharpen my software engineering skills before moving into my career proper, and took COSC 340 in the past under Dr. Austin Henley.
